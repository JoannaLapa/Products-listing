## Overview & assumptions

Pictures were adopted for performance:

- the quality was limited to 70% with Photopea, saved as img and optimised with [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app);

- icon was converted to svg for better performance and easier styling.

Icon dimansions and positioning: 

I assump that: 

- 20px witdh is for a heart and with background-color it is total 28px; 
- I move the middle of a heart icon from the top and right corner of the picture - as it was a part of SVG with background I moved top right corner of SVG with 16px.
