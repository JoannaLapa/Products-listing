## Overview & assumptions

Pictures were adopted for performance:

- the quality was limited to 70% with Photopea, saved as jpg and optimised with [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app);

- icon was converted to svg for better performance and easier styling.

Icon dimansions and positioning: 

I assump that: 

- 20px width is for a heart and with background-color it is total 28px; 
- as an origin to move the heart icon I took the middle of it - from the top and the right corner of the picture to the middle of the heart is 30px.
- icon is only an icon as it was not provided in instructions any role for it. It looks like a button with aria-role "Add to favourite", normally I would ask about that and change the html structure with button tag.

I kept the provided font sizes for mobile design and changed to smaller for desktop design according to mockup look.
