## Overview

    Pictures were adopted for performance - the quality was limited to 70% with Photopea, saved as img and optimised with [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app).

    Icon was converted to svg for better performance and easier styling.

    Icon dimansions and positioning:
     - I assumpt that the 20px witdh is for a heart and with background-color it is total 28px.
     - I assumpt that I move the middle of a heart icon from the top and right corner of the picture - as it was a part of SVG with background I moved top right corner of SVG with 16px.
